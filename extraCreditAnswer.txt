.hasAnyQueensConflicts is O(n^2);



1.) sum up all of the elements in the rows and if it's > 1 then we have conflict


2.) convert the array of 1's and 0's into a decimal and check if it's >1, if it is we have conflict

3.) convert the array of 1's and 0's into a decimal and use bitwise operators to check if > 1, if it is we have conflict. Have a counter and when the bitwise operation detects a 1, incriment counter. 


parseInt(arr.join(''),2);
